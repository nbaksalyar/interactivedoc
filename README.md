# Interactive Rust documentation

This repository is used for coordinating effort to make Rust documentation interactive and explorable.

## Resources

* [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming) by Bret Victor.

## Components

Some of the components are already available as proof-of-concepts:

* **[Compiler service](https://github.com/LowLevelAcademy/server)**. The compilation server for interactive playgrounds, based on play.rust-lang.org.
* **[Docker image](https://github.com/LowLevelAcademy/server/tree/master/deploy/docker)**. A packed version of the Rust compiler that builds into WebAssembly.

## Proof-of-concepts

* **[Low-Level Academy](https://lowlvl.org)**, an interactive systems programming course. Source code is available at [@LowLevelAcademy](https://github.com/lowlevelacademy/).
